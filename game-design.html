				<p>Designed Made and published in less than a month, this title features a campaign and an endless varient for each level.
				</p
				<p>Take control of Earth's newest little explorer, adventuring across Earth, Mars, extra-terrestrial planets, and even a black hole! In the single player campaign, you will need to avoid the aliens as you collect artifacts, and batteries to keep up your energy. But watch out, each command you send takes a few seconds for the rover to receive, so youâ€™ll have to plan ahead! Do you have what it takes to get all the way through? </p>
				<p>With this games in addition to putting out the product, the goal was to develop experience between team members, with art, design, sound, and programming. It was a success in that regard and in many others. With the quick turnaround time design had to be both simple and elegant. So I created a simple but relatively unique and understandable movement system by taking classic movement formulas for mobile and changing the dimensionality of it by putting it on a sphere. Since there wasn't much time for level design it was important to create a  system that could be tweaked to create new and distinct levels easily by managing just a few parameters. In the end I found that the best balance was by giving the player two competing interests, these vary from level to level but to allow for replayability they took the form of having specific locations on the planet be desirable to arrive at but a movement system that was imprecise enough that the player would often make some small mistakes,leading to frantic corrections, this impreciseness comes from a diagetic game element with a delay between an input being sent and recieved by the rover </p>

				<p>My entry to the TAGD semester game jam with the theme 'alternate perspective', and the second place winner
				</p>
				<p>You, secret agent extraordinaire and single mother of two, Karen, have been captured once again by Dr.Retro. Can you climb to the top of the screen and escape in this old school game themed platforming challenge?</p>
				<p>First Person Tetris was all about creating a holistic game experience in order to better understand all the different pieces that go into it. The theme that defines this game 'alternate perspective' brought a few concepts to mind, but the one that really jumped out at me was taking a very familiar concept and changing the literal perspective. Tetris being one of the most iconic games of all time seemed like a fantastic candidate and creating a simple platformer inside it was easy to visualize. After creating an initial prototype the game it became very apparant that although the platforming was interesting some stronger direction was needed. That's where the rising lava and electric zones came in. These provide a moving 'safe zone' that the player has to stay on top of. Another problem was that despite the simple mechanics of tetris, there's a lot of relience on visual queues and by placing the player on top of the game it was akin to blinding them from a large part of what they were doing. To address that and lean even harder into the alternate perspective theme I created a system where the player could swap perspectives as a depleteable resource that would refill over time, keeping the benefits of the new perspective and the platforming that came with but preventing that feeling of confusion that comes with not understanding your enviroment at a glance. Finally in order to make a very well presented experiance the Tetris theme was complimneted by a minimalsit tron aesthetic that leans heavily on a few post-processing effects and some clever use of Unity's particle system </p>

				<p>In this game control is a limited resource, you can only have so many systems on at once! Although your ship has controls for flying, turning, downloading data from comm towers, and a laser blocking shield you can only afford to power two at once. Control is a limited resource and you'll quickly run out trying to do everything at once.</p>
<p>Made for the GMTK 20202 game jam, the making of constelaltion chaos was all about polish. The goal wasto make a seamless experience in 48 hours with the focus being put on pleasent and readable UI, and readable features that work intuitivle mechanicly. With plenty of experimenting with the Unity Animator I think there was a good amount of success to be found, with the largest exception being that the movement could feel a little oddly weighted. Mechanically I wanted to make something fairly relaxed so easy going music and a fairly lenient open ended level were designed so that the actual game functioned more as a playground to test different interactions.</p>

				<p>Chillenium 2019 entry, this game was an experiment in 3D development and multiplayer design.
				</p>
				<p> Inside of a childrens toybox, a war rages, red vs blue. There are no bystanders as the army men are recruited to the tanks of each team and form a tower of guns to take on the recruiter's rival. While their guns might be enough to topple the enemy tower in order to get enough power to destroy the enemy you must launch your own soliders at the enemy. Once they hit the ground though they stand neutral and can be recruited once more in this forever back and forth.</p>
				<p>In order to make a simple game seem more complicated we decided that we wanted to have split screen multiplayer only, while this did constrain the audience to those who had two controllers for the purposes of chillenium it was a non-issue. The decision to make out first group 3D game was a product of coming up with the design first and then realizing that the format was much more conduicive to a 3D space. Initially the only mechanic of the game was to throw large groups of soldiers as a sacrifice to fit the "all for one" theme, however in order to create an interesting series of gamepaly loops we designed it be more of a back and forth by forcing the player to first collect their soldiers and then protect them from being shot by the enemy tower. If a soldier is shot the entire tower above them collapses allowing for underdog comebacks and situation reversals since smaller towers are easier to aim. So the main loop is collect soldiers, throw them at enemy, but the secendary loop of avoid enemy bullets, shoot enemy towers, and spacial control of spawn zones make a much more dynamic experience. The toybox theme was no coincidence either, we wanted the game to have a sort of morbid comedic feel to it but still have this simple aesthetic to it since it was our first time working in 3D. The toy aesthetic means that most things could be simple/blocky and it would be entirely supported by the space while still allwoing enough personality to the pieces that it feels a little funny to jsut be throwing little green men</p>

				<p> The game features original music and six different level designs from Greg Bunch, original art from Evan Balster and Programming and game design from Alex Rose.

				<p>This is not quite a game and more an experiment. I wanted to create a functional 3d movement system that allowed for
				directed action and attacking but using ONLY two buttons</p>
				<p>So I created Super Smashed Brothers Brawl, for whatever reason two brothers are duking it out in the bar. You're constantly stumbling due to
				 being mentally inhibited and so move forward slowly and rotate back and forth. You get one button to rotate against your current rotation and one button to
			   that functions as both a 'run' for quick movement and an attack. Using these two buttons it is possible to navigate the whole labrynth of tables and counters
			   getting around as well as on top of them in some cases. While initially confusing the somewhat disjointed control scheme leads to some really fun and frantic moments
			   in gameplay. Someday I will return to this game and flesh it out with a little sound and basic modelling</p>

				<p>Another experimental personal project, this time exploring narrative storytelling through an explorable enviroment. Also the first major attempt I made at
				doing art for my own games. I wanted to see how well a story could be told using just personal documents and a photo.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately I lost this game when my laptops hard drive failed and I didn't make a backup or upload it anywhere yet so it's remained lost. What it was was a 5-10 minute
				experiance where you could click through some files on a simulated desktop and read a little bit about the owner of a small mom and pop store and their finances. It was short, cute,
			and contained the jarring twist that they had been murdered after being unable to pay a local organized crime group. </p>
